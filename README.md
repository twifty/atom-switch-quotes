# atom-switch-quotes package

Simply place the cursor within a quoted block of text and hit `alt-'`.

##### Supports:
1. Tabbed lines ;)
1. Multi Lines
1. Heredoc and Nowdoc (currently only for PHP, though I will add others soon)
1. Multi cursors

##### Coming soon:
* Interpolated value adjustment (Ie embedding values within strings).
* Concatinating strings.

These are language specific, though I have created the code in such a way as to easily implement these changes.

### Notes
This package is in its early days. I need testers and I need those testers to give feedback. If there any features you require or bugs found, please raise an issue on the github repo.
